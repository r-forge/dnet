\title{Annotations of Mouse Entrez Genes (EG) by Disease Ontology (DO).}


\usage{
org.Mm.egDO <- dRDataLoader(RData='org.Mm.egDO')
}

\description{
An R object that contains associations between Disease Ontology terms and Mouse Entrez Genes. This data is first prepared based on \url{http://sourceforge.net/p/diseaseontology/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/HumanDO.obo?format=raw} and  \url{http://dga.nubic.northwestern.edu/ajax/Download.ajax.php}, which results in annotations of Human Entrez Genes. Then, these annotations are transferred to Mouse Entrez Genes based on \url{ftp://anonymous@ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/HomoloGene/build67/homologene.data}.
}

\value{
    an object of class "GS", a list with following components:
    \itemize{
        \item{\code{set_info}: a matrix of nSet X 4 containing gene set information, where nSet is the number of gene sets (i.e. DO terms), and the 4 columns are "setID" (i.e. "Term ID"), "name" (i.e. "Term Name"), "namespace" and "distance"}
        \item{\code{gs}: a list of gene sets, each storing gene members thereof. Always, gene sets are identified by "setID" and gene members identified by "Entrez ID"}
    }
