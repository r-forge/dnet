\title{Annotations of Human Entrez Genes (EG) by H hallmark collections.}


\usage{
org.Hs.egMsigdbH <- dRDataLoader(RData='org.Hs.egMsigdbH')
}

\description{
This data is prepared based on the molecular signatures database (Msigdb; \url{http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp}). An R object that contains associations between Msigdb H hallmark gene sets and Human Entrez Genes. This collection is the starting point for the exploration of the MSigDB resource. Hallmark gene sets summarize and represent specific well-defined biological states or processes and display coherent expression. These gene sets were generated by a computational methodology based on identifying gene set overlaps and retaining genes that display coordinate expression. The hallmarks reduce noise and redundancy and provide a better delineated biological space.
}

\value{
    an object of class "GS", a list with following components:
    \itemize{
        \item{\code{set_info}: a matrix of nSet X 4 containing gene set information, where nSet is the number of gene sets, and the 4 columns are "setID" (i.e. "Geneset systematic name"), "name" (i.e. "Geneset standard description"), "namespace" (i.e. Geneset category code) and "distance" (i.e. "Geneset brief description")}
        \item{\code{gs}: a list of gene sets, each storing gene members thereof. Always, gene sets are identified by "setID" and gene members identified by "Entrez ID"}
    }
