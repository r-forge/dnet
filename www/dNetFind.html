      <h2>Function to find heuristically maximum scoring module</h2>

<div class="row">

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><code>dNetFind</code> is supposed to find the maximum scoring
module from an input graph and scores imposed on its nodes.
The input graph and the output module are both of "igraph"
or "graphNET" object. The input scores imposed on the nodes
in the input graph can be divided into two parts: the
positve nodes and the negative nodes. The searching for
maximum scoring module is deduced to find the connected
subgraph containing the positive nodes as many as possible,
but the negative nodes as few as possible. To this end, a
heuristic search is used (see Note below).</p>
  
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <pre>dNetFind(g, scores)</pre>
    
    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>g</dt>
      <dd>an object of class "igraph" or "graphNEL"</dd>
      <dt>scores</dt>
      <dd>a vector of scores. For each element, it
must have the name that could be mapped onto the input
graph. Also, the names in input "scores" should contain
all those in the input graph "g", but the reverse is not
necessary</dd>

      <h3>Value</h3>
      
      <p>a module with a maximum score, an object of class "igraph"
or "graphNEL"</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Note">
      <h3>Note</h3>
      
      <p>The search procedure is heuristic to find the module with
the maximum score: <ul>
<li>i) transform the input
graph into a new graph by collapsing connected positive
nodes into a meta-node. As such, meta-nodes are isolated to
each other but are linked via negative nodes
(single-nodes). Clearly, meta-nodes have positive scores,
and negative scores for the single-nodes. </li>
<li>ii) append
the weight attribute to the edges in the transformed graph.
There are two types of edges: 1) the single-single edge
with two single-nodes as two ends, and 2) single-meta edge
with a single-node as one end and a meta-node as the other
end. The weight for a single-single edge is the absolute
sum of the scores in its two-end single-nodes but
normalised by their degrees. The weight for a single-meta
edge is simply the absolute score in its single-node end
normalised by the degree. As such, weights are all
non-negative. </li>
<li>iii) find minimum spanning tree (MST)
in the weighted transformed graph using Prim's greedy
algorithm. A spanning tree of the weighted graph is a
subgraph that is tree and connects all the node together.
The MST is a spanning tree with the sum of its edge weights
minimised among all possible spanning trees. </li>
<li>iv)
find all shortest paths between any pair of meta-nodes in
the MST. Within the weighted transformed graph in ii), a
subgraph is induced containing nodes (only occuring in
these shortest paths) and all edges between them. </li>
<li>v)
within the induced subgraph, identify single-nodes that are
direct neighbors of meta-nodes. For each of these
single-nodes, also make sure it has the absolute scores no
more than the sum of scores in its neighboring meta-nodes.
These single-nodes meeting both criteria are called
"linkers". </li>
<li>vi) still within the induced subgraph in
v), find the linker graph that contains only linkers and
edges between them. Similarly to iii), find MST of the
linker graph, called 'linker MST'. Notably, this linker MST
serves as the scaffold, which only contains linkers but has
meta-nodes being direcly attached to. </li>
<li>vii) in linker
MST plus its attached meta-nodes, find the optimal path
that has the sum of scores of its nodes and attached
meta-nodes maximised amongest all possible paths. Nodes
along this optimal path plus their attached meta-nodes are
called 'module nodes'. </li>
<li>viii) finally, from the input
graph extract a subgraph (called 'module') that only
contains module nodes and edges betwen them. This module is
the maximum scoring module containing the positive nodes as
many as possible, but the negative nodes as few as
possible. </li>
