\title{Gene expression datasets across four conditions (shared by 228 individuals) from Benjamin et al. (2014)}

\usage{
JKscience_expression <- dRDataLoader(RData.customised='JKscience_expression')
}

\description{
This dataset involves 228 individuals with expression data for all four conditions/contexts, that is, in the naive state (CD14), after 2-hour LPS (LPS2), after 24-hour LPS (LPS24), and after exposure to IFN (IFN). Also included are the probe information and the demographics information about individuals. For genotype data for these individuals, please refer to \code{\link{JKscience_genotype}}.
}

\value{
    a list with 3 components:
    \itemize{
        \item{\code{eContext}: a list of 4 components, each for one of four conditions/contexts (that is, "CD14", "LPS2", "LPS24" and "IFN") and each containing a matrix of probes X individuals}
        \item{\code{probeInfo}: a list of 2 components, both storing probe information including their genomic locations. The component \code{JKscience_expression$probeInfo$Info} contains a data frame, the second \code{JKscience_expression$probeInfo$GR} is an object of class "GRanges"}
        \item{\code{demoInfo}: a data frame containing demographics information about individuals}
