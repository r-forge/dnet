Description: The 'dnet' package is initiated to fill in the need of an open-source tool for analysing biological networks and high-throughput biological data in an integrative manner. More specifically, dnet intends to analyse the biological network whose nodes/genes are associated with digitised information such as expression levels across samples. To help make sense of identified subnetworks, enrichment analysis is also supported using a wide variety of pre-compiled ontologies and their annotated genes in major organisms including human, mouse, rat, chicken, C.elegans, fruit fly, zebrafish and arabidopsis. In summary, dnet aims to deliver an eye-intuitive tool for network-based understanding of high-throughput digitised biological data.
