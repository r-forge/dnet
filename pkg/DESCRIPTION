Description: The 'dnet' package is initiased to fill in the need of an open-source tool for analysing biological networks and high-throughput biological data in an integrative manner. More specifically, dnet intends to analyse the biological network whose nodes/genes are associated with numeric properties such as expression patterns across a series of samples in subject. Also, dnet aims to deliver an eye-intuitive tool for network-based sample stratifications.
