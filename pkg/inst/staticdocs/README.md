## Introduction

`dnet` is an open-source R package for integrative analysis of `network`, `expression`, `evolution` and `ontology` data. 

`dnet` intends to analyse the biological network whose nodes/genes are associated with dynamic information such as expression levels across samples, with aims to identify expression-active dynamic subnetworks.

`dnet` also supports enrichment analysis using a variety of ontologies and using gene phylostratific age information. 

`dnet` is able to conduct analyses in `human` but also many common model organisms: `mouse`, `rat`, `chicken`, `c.elegans`, `fruitfly`, `zebrafish` and `arabidopsis`.

`dnet` aims to deliver an eye-intuitive tool for network-based sample stratifications.

## Features

* An integrated framework for integration of network and expression information for classifying/stratifying samples
* Identification of expression-active dynamic subnetworks
* Network-based sample stratifications 
* Visualisations of network-based sample stratifications on 2D landscape
* Enrichment analysis (Fisher's exact test and GSEA) that can respect the hierarchy of the ontology
* A wide variety of built-in data: ontologies (including `Gene Ontology`, `Disease Ontology`, `Human Phenotype` and `Mammalian Phenotype`), phylostratific age information and gene association networks in human and common organisms. On details, please refer to [RData](http://dnet.r-forge.r-project.org/rdata.html).
* This package can run on `Windows`, `Mac` and `Linux`
