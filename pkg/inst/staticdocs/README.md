## Introduction

`dnet` is an open-source R package for analysing biological networks and high-throughput biological data in an integrative manner. The supra-hexagonal map is a giant hexagon on a 2-dimensional map grid seamlessly consisting of smaller hexagons. It intends to meet the need for quickly understanding genome-wide biological data, which usually involve a large number of genomic coordinates (e.g. genes) but a much smaller number of samples. 

`dnet` intends to analyse the biological network whose nodes/genes are associated with numeric properties such as expression patterns across a series of samples in subject.

`dnet` aims to deliver an eye-intuitive tool for network-based sample stratifications.

## Features

* An integrated framework for integration of network and expression information for classifying/stratifying samples
* Identification of expression-active dynamic subnetworks
* Network-based sample stratifications 
* Visualisations of networks on 2D sample landscape
* This package can run on `Windows`, `Mac` and `Linux`
